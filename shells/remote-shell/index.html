<div flex row container>
  <span big>Remote Shell</span>
  <span>
    Remote Shell owns the other two processes and connects things together.
    Remote Shell gets things started by sending commands to the Pipes Shell.
    Remote Shell forwards rendering commands to the Rendering Surface which composes actual DOM.
  </span>

  <div orange row container>
    <span big>Pipes Shell</span>
    <span>
      Pipes Shell is spawned in it's own Window, equivalent to spinning up a WebView or Node process.
      It doesn't generally render anything, although we could render diagnostic information there.
    </span>
    <span>Pipes Shell is where the runtime code lives. It needs commands to do anything.</span>

  <div purple row container>
    <span big>Rendering Surface</span>
    <span>
      This Rendering Surface is spawned in it's own Window, equivalent to spinning up a WebView or Node process.
      There could be N of these.

  <span big>Demo</span>
  <span>
    Remote Shell starts by spinning up an Arc with Notification recipe.
    The Notification recipe renders a slot with <b>notification modality</b> (which is implemented
    in Remote Shell via a simple Toast api). The notification should popup in the lower-right corner.
    Click the notification to spin up a Restaurants Arc with it's own rendering surface.
